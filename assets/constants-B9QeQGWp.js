                        The goal of this project is to create an intelligent bot

                                Designing and developing Algorithms for maps are the most difficult tasks in this 
                                project. I have to search through lots of documents to get more ideas for 
                                creating a bot on a 9x9 map and larger. For a 3x3 map, simply setting 
                                the Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm is sufficient for the bot to solve it. 
                                However, on a 9x9 map, it is too wide for the Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm alone, 
                                so we need to combine it with another algorithm. Fortunately, I found the 
                                Heuristic algorithm, which can be combined with the Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm 
                                to solve this problem.`,ImageFeature:[{Src:b,Alt:"maps selection display"},{Src:f,Alt:"maps selection display"},{Src:w,Alt:"maps selection display"},{Src:S,Alt:"maps selection display"}]},{NameFeature:"Level & turn",DescriptionFeature:`

                                by degrading the algorithm so it couldn't think as effectively. Similarly, I started 
                                developing with the first turn being the player's turn, so I just changed it 
                                to the bot's turn.`,ImageFeature:[{Src:A,Alt:"maps selection display"},{Src:D,Alt:"maps selection display"}]},{NameFeature:"AIvsAI mode",DescriptionFeature:`
